# rust
Trying out rust sample programs.

# Key points
* strongly typed
* statically typed
* all memory accesses are checked
* array-bounds are checked
* code organized as
    * functions : similar to c++ functions
    * modules : similar to namespaces/files in c++, math can be a module
    * crates : similar to an executable/library/plugin/extension, json would be a crate

# Cargo
Cargo is the package manager for Rust.
`cargo build` for building `Cargo.toml` which is the build config file.
